<h1>How <span class="caps">PHP</span> Wax Uses the Model View Controller Pattern</h1>


	<p>This isn&#8217;t meant as a complete description of the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern, if it&#8217;s a new word for you then a bit of research may be in order. However everyone&#8217;s definition of <span class="caps">MVC</span> is a little different so what follows is a basic summary of how <span class="caps">PHP</span> Wax uses the pattern to organise an application.</p>


	<p>If you have a browse through your newly created application folder you&#8217;ll see the following structure:</p>


<pre>
  ./app
    ./config
    ./controller
    ./db
    ./lib
    ./model
    ./view
  capfile
  ./plugins
  ./public
    ./images
    ./javascripts
    ./stylesheets
  ./script
  ./tmp
    ./log
    ./cache
</pre>

	<p>By way of a brief introduction to this setup here&#8217;s a brief summary of an application&#8217;s components.</p>


	<h2>The app directory</h2>


	<p>First up, the app directory contains a few subdirectories. The first of these is the config directory. By default this will contain two files, <code>config.yml</code> and <code>environment.php</code>.</p>
