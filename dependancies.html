<h1>Dependancies</h1>

<p>Certain functions within the framework require 3<sup>rd</sup> party libraries / software. We always try to keep these to a minimum and only use the most commonly found setups.</p>
<p>Please be aware that although this framework is extensively tested on various Linux &amp; OS X platforms it has not been throughly tried on Windows ... yet ...</p>

<h2>PHP</h2>

<p>Strangely enough our <acronym class='caps'>PHP</acronym> framework needs <acronym class='caps'>PHP</acronym> to be installed. As we like <acronym class='caps'>OO</acroym> and due to the several security fixes please use <em>version 5.2.6 or greater</em>.</p>

<h2>PDO</h2>

<p>For our databases we use <acronym class="caps">PDO</acronym> in order to keep the model code as agnostic as possible.</p>
<p>Your version of <acronym class="caps">PHP</acronym> will need to have this installed.</p>

<h2>Image Magick</h2>

<p>To use some of the built in image manipulation functions this will need to be installed on your system and available in the system path.</p>
