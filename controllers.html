<h1>How To Use Controllers</h1>

<h2>Basic Functionality</h2>

<p>
  Controllers are where the application logic is stored. This may involve fetching information from the database 
  via the <em>model</em> layer and then defining what information is made available to the <em>view</em> layer 
  which is then displayed to the user.
</p>

<p>
  Out of the box, PHP Wax takes care of basic URL mapping to controller actions. For example if you look in your default
  controller <em>app/controller/PageController.php</em> you'll see you have a method named <em>index</em>.
  This gets run by default when you hit the root of a site. Try visiting your local site and you'll see the default page.
</p>
<p>
  Any public method we make in this controller will map to a url. Let's try a test:
</p>
<code>
{% highlight ruby %}
  public function test() {
    echo "HELLO WORLD";
    exit;
  }
{% endhighlight %}
</code>
<p>
  Now if you go to <em>http://yoursite.local/test</em> you'll get the hello world message.
