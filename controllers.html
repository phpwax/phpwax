<h1>How To Use Controllers</h1>

<h2>Basic Functionality</h2>

<p>Controllers are where the application logic is stored. This may involve fetching information from the database via the <em>model</em> layer and then defining what information is made available to the <em>view</em> layer which is then displayed to the user.</p>

<p>Out of the box, PHP Wax takes care of basic URL mapping to controller actions. For example if you look in your default controller <em>app/controller/PageController.php</em> you'll see you have a method named <em>index</em>. This gets run by default when you hit the root of a site. Try visiting your local site and you'll see the default page.</p>
<p>Any public method we make in this controller will map to a url. Let's try a test:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
public function test() {
  echo "HELLO WORLD";
  exit;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now if you go to <em>http://yoursite.local/test</em> you'll get the hello world message.</p>

<h2>Matching URLs, Method Names and Views</h2>

<p>As <acronym class='caps' title='Pre Hypertext Processor'>PHP<//acronym> doesn't support - inside function names these are replaced in the URL with and underscore (_) and this will be the name of the method.</p>
<p>For example, <em>http://yoursite.local/contact-us</em> will look for a public method called <em>contact_us</em></p>
<p>In such cases the name of the view will match the url style, with hyphens (-).</p>
