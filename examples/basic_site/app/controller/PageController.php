	 * The websites sitemap. This is a little bit smarter then the other actions. Here we introduce the idea of how easy it is to swap
	 * formats in the phpwax framework.
	 * 
	 * The framework checks the url (ie mydomain.com/about-me) for an extension (.html, .xml, .rss, .json etc) and changes the 'format' variable.
	 * The format variable is used when looking for 'views'. For example mydomain.com/about-me.html looks for a file called about-me.html 
	 * where as mydomain.com/about-me.xml would look for a file called about-me.xml
	 *
	 * This mean you do lovely things like providing all of your content in rss format as well as html
	 *
	 * Also means that any logic you want to do, like pulling data from models (see a more advanced site demo), can be done just once
	 *
	 * In this example we see how it is used to create both a html and a google xml sitemap in one 'action'

			//and change the header type to be xml so it renders correctly
			header("Content-Type: text/xml");

			$this->base_url = "http://".$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'];
