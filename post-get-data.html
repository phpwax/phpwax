<h1>Accessing Post / Get Data</h1>

<p>
  You may be used to using PHP's built in global accessors to get at url and form variables. Maybe something like this:
</p>
<pre>
  $page = $_GET["page"];
  $name = $_POST["name"];
</pre>
<p>Whilst this is simple enough to use, if you subsequently want to output these values in your HTML you're opening yourself up to security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>PHP-Wax provides a couple of helper methods that will take care of sanitising these values, and they're also shorter to type.</p>
<h2>The helpers</h2>
<pre>$page = get("page");</pre>
<pre>$name = post("name");</pre>
