<h1>Setting Up Models</h1>


<p>
	Models are one of the three tiers of the <span class="caps">MVC</span> pattern. 
	They are used to define an applications interaction with the database.
</p>


<p>
  PHP Wax takes care of saving your models to the database with as little hassle as possible, it can also 
  handle different types of joins between database tables. 
</p>

<h2>Setting up models and defining fields</h2>

<p>
  Here's an example of how a model is setup. This model handles a user table in the database:
</p>

<code>
{% highlight php %}
class User extends WaxModel {  

  public function setup() {
    $this->define("name", "CharField");
    $this->define("email", "CharField");
		$this->define("username", "CharField");
		$this->define("password", "PasswordField");
		$this->define("twitter", "CharField");
		$this->define("flickr", "CharField");
	}
  	
}
{% endhighlight %}  
</code>
