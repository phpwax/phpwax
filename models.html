<h1>Setting Up Models</h1>


<p>
	Models are one of the three tiers of the <span class="caps">MVC</span> pattern. 
	They are used to define an applications interaction with the database.
</p>


<p>
  PHP Wax takes care of saving your models to the database with as little hassle as possible, it can also 
  handle different types of joins between database tables. 
</p>

<h2>Setting up models and defining fields</h2>

<p>
  Here's an example of how a model is setup. This model handles a user table in the database:
</p>

<code>
{% highlight php %}
class User extends WaxModel {  

  public function setup() {
    $this->define("name", "CharField");
    $this->define("email", "CharField");
		$this->define("username", "CharField", array("required"=>true));
		$this->define("password", "PasswordField");
		$this->define("twitter", "CharField");
		$this->define("flickr", "CharField");
	}
  	
}
{% endhighlight %}  
</code>

<h2>How to Define Fields</h2>
<p>
  As you can see in the code example above all of the model's definition gets done in a special method, 'setup'.
  A call to this->define can take three arguments, firstly the name of the field, the second is the type of field and the
  third is an array of options that customises the database and validation behaviour.
</p>
<p>
  PHP Wax has quite a few built in field types and the second argument refers to a class which handles the behaviour.
  As you can see in the example above the most popular value is <em>CharField</em> this is the database equivalent of
  <em>varchar</em> and is used for short textual values, normally that require fewer than 255 characters.
</p>
