<h1>Creating and Saving Forms</h1>

<p>
  Creating forms can often be a very time consuming process but fortunately PHP Wax tries to make the process
  a lot easier.
</p>

<p>
  To make things easier to understand we're going to cover two different types of form in this tutorial, forms
  that are bound to models, and forms that are standalone.
</p>

<h2>Handling Bound Forms</h2>
<p>
  Since you've done all the hard work in your model definition it makes sense to reuse that application logic to 
  create your forms, since it's often the case that forms are just a way of getting data from the user into the
  database. We'll use the User model we created in the earlier tutorial to demonstrate how this works.
</p>
<p>
  Remembering the correct way to separate our application code from the templates we'll create a form in our controller
  and then create a template to render it.
</p>
<p>
  Here's the controller code which you can drop into app/controller/PageController.php:
</p>
<code>
{% highlight ruby %}
  public function test() {
    $user = new User;
    $fred = $user->filter("username", "fred")->first();
    $this->form = new WaxForm($fred);
  }
{% endhighlight %}
