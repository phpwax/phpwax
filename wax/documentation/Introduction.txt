h1. An Introduction to PHP Wax

h2. A Web Framework for PHP

The more we write and design web applications the more it becomes obvious that the majority share a core set of functionality.

The simple things that you may do day in and day out such as querying a database, creating forms, sending emails and structuring a website layout often involves a great deal of repetitive work.

It's for this reason that a well designed framework can help us to become much more efficient as well as helping to produce software with fewer bugs.

h2. Why PHP Wax?

Many frameworks are designed to be accessible to all competencies of programmers which often results in software that is bloated or unnecessarily abstracted.

First up PHP Wax is designed for developers working in a professional environment with a good knowledge of object oriented programming. If you're more used to procedural style programming then you may want to do a little swotting before you get stuck in.

The second thing to remember is that often, PHP Wax will use some of the more advanced features of the PHP language so you will need to have a fairly up to date version of the language and occasionally the ability to install extra dependencies too.

If all that doesn't scare you off then sit back and start to enjoy programming again.
