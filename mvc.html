<h1>How <acronym class="caps" title='Pre Hypertext Processor'>PHP</acronym> Wax Uses the Model View Controller Pattern</h1>

<p>This isn't meant as a complete description of the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern, if it's a new word for you then a bit of research may be in order. However everyone's definition of <acronym class="caps" title='Model View Controller'>MVC</acronym> is a little different so what follows is a basic summary of how <acronym class="caps" title='Pre Hypertext Processor'>PHP</acronym> Wax uses the pattern to organise an application.</p>
<p>If you have a browse through your newly created application folder you'll see the following structure:</p>

<pre>
./app
  ./config
  ./controller
  ./db
  ./lib
  ./model
  ./view
capfile
./plugins
./public
  ./images
  ./javascripts
  ./stylesheets
./script
./tmp
  ./log
  ./cache
</pre>

<p>By way of a brief introduction to this setup here's a brief summary of an application's components.</p>

<h2>The <em>app</em> directory</h2>

<p>First up, the app directory contains a few subdirectories. The first of these is the config directory. By default this will contain four files, <em>config.yml</em>, <em>environment.php</em>, <em>production.php</em>, and <em>development.php</em>.</p>

<h3>config.yml</h3>

<p>You standard configuration file. By default this handles the database setup and other items such as the <a href='/phpwax/cache.html'>cache configuration</a>.</p>

<h3>environment.php</h3>

<p>The environment file is the first file to be included by the framework (inside the <em>index.php</em> file). It sets up 2 constants that are used within the framework:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>WAX_ROOT</em> - The directory the website is running out of.</li>
  <li><em>FRAMEWORK_DIR</em> - The location of the PHP Wax folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very rare that you will ever need to change either of those to variables. Once these are set then the <em>WAX_ROOT</em> is added to <acronym class='caps' title='Pre Hypertext Processor'>PHP<//acronym>s include path.</p>
<p>The main <em>AutoLoader.php</em> is now loaded.</p>

<h3>production.php and development.php</h3>

<p>These two files are used for settings that you want to either change or add config settings depending on what environment you are running in.</p>
<p>For example; on your live production server you might want to enable caching on your layout but obviously while you are developing the site you would not want to do that.</p>
<p>Using the <em>Config::set()</em> and <em>Config::get()</em> methods in this file you can do that.</p>

<h2>The <em>capfile</em></h2>

<p>This is a <em>capistrano</em> file used for deploying your site.</p>
