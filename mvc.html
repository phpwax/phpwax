<h1>How <acronym class="caps">PHP</acronym> Wax Uses the Model View Controller Pattern</h1>

<p>This isn't meant as a complete description of the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern, if it's a new word for you then a bit of research may be in order. However everyone's definition of <acronym class="caps">MVC</acronym> is a little different so what follows is a basic summary of how <acronym class="caps">PHP</acronym> Wax uses the pattern to organise an application.</p>
<p>If you have a browse through your newly created application folder you'll see the following structure:</p>

<code>
./app
  ./config
  ./controller
  ./db
  ./lib
  ./model
  ./view
capfile
./plugins
./public
  ./images
  ./javascripts
  ./stylesheets
./script
./tmp
  ./log
  ./cache
</code>

<p>By way of a brief introduction to this setup here's a brief summary of an application's components.</p>

<h2>The app directory</h2>

<p>First up, the app directory contains a few subdirectories. The first of these is the config directory. By default this will contain two files, <em>config.yml</em> and <em>environment.php</em>.</p>
