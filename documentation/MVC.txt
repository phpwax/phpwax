h1. How PHP Wax Uses the Model View Controller Pattern

This isn't meant as a complete description of the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern, if it's a new word for you then a bit of research may be in order. However everyone's definition of MVC is a little different so what follows is a basic summary of how PHP Wax uses the pattern to organise an application.

If you have a browse through your newly created application folder you'll see the following structure:

<pre>
  ./app
    ./config
    ./controller
    ./db
    ./lib
    ./model
    ./view
  capfile
  ./plugins
  ./public
    ./images
    ./javascripts
    ./stylesheets
  ./script
  ./tmp
    ./log
    ./cache
</pre>

By way of a brief introduction to this setup here's a brief summary of an application's components.

h2. The app directory

First up, the app directory contains a few subdirectories. The first of these is the config directory. By default this will contain two files, @config.yml@ and @environment.php@.
