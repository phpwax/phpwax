<h1>Connecting to a Database</h1>
<p>
  For most web applications, a database backend is an essential component and luckily, PHP Wax makes it super easy
  to get going.
</p>
<p>
  Inside your app/config folder you'll find a <em>yaml</em> file - <em>config.yml</em>. This is where you can add
  configuration values for your application.
</p>
<p>
  The settings we are interested in are for the db. You'll notice that in the example file there's three separate settings
  for the database and these are wrapped inside an environment specific setting. The reason for this is to allow you to have
  separate setups for development and production environments. Take a look at the sample file:
</p>
<code>
{% highlight yaml %}

  development:
   db:
    dbtype: mysql  
    host: localhost
    database: app_development
    username: root

  test:
    db:
      dbtype: mysql
      host: localhost
      database: app_test
      username: root

  production: 
    db: 
      dbtype: mysql
      host: localhost
      database: app_production
      username: app_name
      password: app_secret
      
      
{% endhighlight %}  
</code>

<p>
  At the moment we're just concerned with our development environment so edit these settings to reflect your local
  username and password.
